A Student Management System is a comprehensive project designed to streamline the administrative tasks associated with managing student information. This system allows users to insert new student details, update existing records, delete outdated or incorrect entries, and view detailed information about each student. By providing a centralized platform for handling student data, the project aims to enhance efficiency and accuracy in educational institutions. It ensures that all student-related information is easily accessible and manageable, reducing the time and effort required for administrative tasks and allowing educators to focus more on teaching and student development.
